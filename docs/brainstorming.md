This document is for brainstorming future changes to the Venice language. All ideas are preliminary and may or may not actually be implemented.

- Special annotations for functions and variables
  - e.g., for functions: pure
  - e.g., for variables: non-empty (for lists), positive (for integers)
- Exceptions or explicit error values?
  - Standard library should favor explicit error values, but exceptions should also be possible
  - Exceptions are useful while writing code because you don't need to change the return value of the function.
  - Also, exceptions print stack traces.
  - Checked exceptions?

- Use `final` instead of `let` for immutable bindings
- `if x matches y` instead of `if let x = y`
- Numeric units (e.g. `10s`)
- Tooling
  - Package manager
  - Linter
  - Code formatter
- Call `bytes` objects `blob` instead
- `\(...)` instead of `${...}` for string interpolation
- `if not let` statements
