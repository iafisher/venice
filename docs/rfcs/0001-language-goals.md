- Completed: TBD
- Status: draft

## Summary
A description of the goals of the Venice programming language. See RFC-0002 for a technical reference of the language's syntax and semantics.

## Goals
- Replace Python as my day-to-day language for personal projects
  - In order to do so...
    - Statically-typed
    - High-level
    - Modern languages features from languages like Rust (e.g., pattern matching, sum types)
    - Provisions for medium-to-large projects (e.g., separate files)
    - Run on x86-64 Linux systems

## Non-goals
