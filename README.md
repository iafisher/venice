# Venice
Venice is a high-level, statically-typed programming language. It pairs the convenience of Python with the static typing and modern language features of Rust.

<!-- TODO(2021-07-21): Put a concise but demonstrative example of Venice code here. -->

**NOTE**: Venice is currently in the design phase.

For a comprehensive description of the language, see `docs/reference.md`.
